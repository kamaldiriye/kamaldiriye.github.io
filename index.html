    <h3>2D Project: Football Heads</h3>
    <p>
	This project involveed me building a functional 2D Game using the City Engine Physics library. My 2D project for this term is a two player game that consist of two characters controlled by the players using the keyboard. The 2D game has five levels in were the game progresses when the player reach a certain amount of goals for the first three level. In the last two levels, these levels have a one minute countdown and when the countdown finishes in level five the game progresses and In the last level the game ends when the one minute countdown ends.The controls for this game is w,a,d and space bar to kick for the left hand player and for the right hand player are the arrows and P to kick. The challenges that I faced for the project was incorporating everything do that it could work as one from the sounds to the collisions these were the main challenges to the game.
